                        During the Second Boer War (1899 to 1902), part of the castle was used as a prison, and
                        the former cells remain to this day.

                        facilities
                        for
                        the traditional Cape Regiments.
                        During 1664, tensions between Britain and the Netherlands rose amid rumours of war.
                        That
                        same year, Commander Zacharias Wagenaer, successor to Jan van Riebeeck, was instructed
                        by
                        Commissioner Isbrand Goske to build a pentagonal fortress out of stone. The first stone
                        was
                        laid on 2 January 1666. Work was interrupted frequently because the DEIC was reluctant
                        to
                        spend money on the project.

                        In 2002 the Museum was able to purchase the building from a generous grant received from a
                        donor,
                        Atlantic Philanthropies.
                        The then owner, Mr Martin Futeran, offered a substantial reduction on
                        the
                        purchase price and this put it within reach of the Museum from a cost point of view.
                        The
                        building is
                        ideally located just two blocks away from the original Museum building and is symbolically
                        well
                        situated at the edge of the area nominated as a National Heritage Site.

                        The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning
                        architects
                        being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors
                        being
                        Messrs.
                        . Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and
                        fittings
                        was imported from Europe.

                        The tower of the City Hall has a Turret Clock which strikes the hours and chimes the
                        Westminster quarters. The faces of the clock are made from 4 skeleton iron dials
                        filled with opal. The clock has a 24-hour wheel and lever. The bells were cast by
                        Messrs John Taylor and Co of Loughborough and the clock was supplied by JB Joyce &
                        Co of Whitchurch.
