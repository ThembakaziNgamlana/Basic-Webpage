                <p class="col-6">
                   During the Second Boer War (1899 to 1902), part of the castle was used as a prison, and
                   the former cells remain to this day.
                   Army in the Western Cape, and today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial
                   facilities
                   for
                   the traditional Cape Regiments.
                   During 1664, tensions between Britain and the Netherlands rose amid rumours of war.
                   That
                   same year, Commander Zacharias Wagenaer, successor to Jan van Riebeeck, was instructed
                   by
                   Commissioner Isbrand Goske to build a pentagonal fortress out of stone. The first stone
                   was
                   laid on 2 January 1666. Work was interrupted frequently because the DEIC was reluctant
                   to
                   spend money on the project.

                <p class="col-6">
                    In 2002 the Museum was able to purchase the building from a generous grant received from a
                    donor,
                    Atlantic Philanthropies.
                    The then owner, Mr Martin Futeran, offered a substantial reduction on
                    the
                    purchase price and this put it within reach of the Museum from a cost point of view.
                    The
                    building is
                    ideally located just two blocks away from the original Museum building and is symbolically
                    well
                    situated at the edge of the area nominated as a National Heritage Site.

                The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning
                architects
                being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors
                being
                Messrs.
                . Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and
                fittings
                was imported from Europe.
                The tower of the City Hall has a Turret Clock which strikes the hours and chimes the
                Westminster quarters. The faces of the clock are made from 4 skeleton iron dials
                filled with opal. The clock has a 24-hour wheel and lever. The bells were cast by
                Messrs John Taylor and Co of Loughborough and the clock was supplied by JB Joyce &
                Co of Whitchurch.
